SplitWise Smart Contract
The SplitWise Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain for splitting expenses among contributors. It allows multiple users to contribute funds towards an expense and automatically distributes the cost among them.

Features
Contributors can add verified users and expenses.
Expenses are automatically split among contributors based on their contributions.
Users can settle outstanding balances by making payments.
Prerequisites
Node.js installed
Truffle Suite installed
An Ethereum development environment (e.g., Ganache)
